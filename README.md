## Task 1
#### Movie Genre Classification
Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a
movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You
can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers
such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector
Machines.
## Task 3
#### Costumer Churn Prediction
Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription- based
service or business. Use historical customer data, including features like
usage behavior and customer demographics, and try algorithms like
Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict
churn.
## Task 4
#### Spam SMS Detection
Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or
legitimate. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with
classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector
Machines to identify spam messages.
